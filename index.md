## About Me 👦

I am currently a first-year Ph.D student in [Media Analytics and Computing Lab (MAC)](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/), Artificial Intelligence Department, School of Informatics, Xiamen University, China.
<br>
My supervisor is [Prof. Rongrong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji_en/).

## Research Interests

My research interests are in Computer Vison, Multimedia and Machine Learning.
<br>
Recently, I focus on:

- Weakly supervised object localization and detection
- Video analysis, including detection and classification

## Internship Experience

- **Tencent Youtu** [ ⌛ May 2021 – Present | 📍 Shanghai, China ] <br>
I was advised by Changan Wang. I mainly conducted research on weakly supervised object localization.

- **Tencent Youtu** [ ⌛ Oct. 2019 – Jan. 2020 | 📍 Shanghai, China ] <br>
I was advised by Bo Yang. I mainly conducted research on neural network compression and quantization. We formulated a trackable optimization problem for quantization error in every single layer. By minimizing the quantization error, the optimal quantization boundary can be found and self-adapt to the distributions of activations in different layers.


## Selected Project Experience

- **Tongan Xueliang project**<br>

&ensp;&ensp;This project provides a plug and play intelligent video analysis platform for ordinary HD cameras. The product carries out real-time detection for six categories of people, bicycle, motorcycle, truck, car and bus, including intelligent recognition and analysis of face and license plate. It adopts a high-temperature and wear-resistant compact material casting shell, which can be remotely connected or directly connected with the camera to adapt to any environment deployment. For the cost, a low-cost ordinary HD camera with our product can realize all functions of a high-cost intelligent camera, saving the time and cost of large-scale deployment.
