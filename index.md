## Internship Experience

- **Tencent Youtu** [ ‚åõ May 2021 ‚Äì Sep. 2021 | üìç Shanghai, China ] <br>
I was advised by Changan Wang. I mainly conducted research on weakly supervised object localization. We proposed a novel framework built upon the transformer, which targets at enhancing the local perception capability of global features among long-range feature dependencies.

- **Tencent Youtu** [ ‚åõ Oct. 2019 ‚Äì Jan. 2020 | üìç Shanghai, China ] <br>
I was advised by Bo Yang. I mainly conducted research on neural network compression and quantization. We formulated a trackable optimization problem for quantization error in every single layer. By minimizing the quantization error, the optimal quantization boundary can be found and self-adapt to the distributions of activations in different layers.

&ensp;&ensp;This project provides a plug and play intelligent video analysis platform for ordinary HD cameras. The product carries out real-time detection for six categories of people, bicycle, motorcycle, truck, car and bus, including intelligent recognition and analysis of face and license plate. It adopts a high-temperature and wear-resistant compact material casting shell, which can be remotely connected or directly connected with the camera to adapt to any environment deployment. For the cost, a low-cost ordinary HD camera with our product can realize all functions of a high-cost intelligent camera, saving the time and cost of large-scale deployment.
